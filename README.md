# A JavaScript only Blog Engine with A Strange Name

## Note
It's a toy project, so I can't guaranty anything about security, data integrity and more.

## `bright-macel-kernel`
The _Marcel Kernel_ became the _Bright_ one because of Github suggestions.

It's the _core_, the _kernel_, the _engine_ of a small blog made of `.less` and `.js` files,
without any server _engine_. All is running from the client... Sorry, it's a static site manager with some cool ___front end___ stuff and nothing in the ___backend___.

I only test it on ___Firefox___ and ___Chromium__ under __Linux___ and with versions not older than 2018.

## What I've learnt
