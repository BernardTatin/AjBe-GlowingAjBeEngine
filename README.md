# A JavaScript only Blog Engine with A Strange Name

## Note
It's a toy project, so I can't guaranty anything about security, data integrity and more.

## `bright-macel-kernel`
The _Marcel Kernel_ became the _Bright_ one because of Github suggestions.

It's the _core_, the _kernel_, the _engine_ of a small blog made of `.less` and `.js` files,
without any server _engine_. All is running from the client... Sorry, it's a static site manager with some cool ___front end___ stuff and nothing in the ___backend___.

I only test it on ___Firefox___ and ___Chromium__ under __Linux___ and with versions not older than 2018.

## What I've learnt

- I first used ___JavaScript___ 20 years ago, that's certainly why my memories were degraded,
- ___JavaScript___ evolved during all these years,
- you must not forget that ___JavaScript___ is __weird__, very few languages use __prototypes__ instead of classes,
- frameworks tends to create a new language, so you lose contact with core ___JavaScript___.

## why this code?
I wanted a little site manager without backend in which each page I add are in ___HTML___, this let me add ___SVG___, ___JavaScript___ as I want. Even if t's not a good sample of code, it works as I want.
