# A JavaScript only Blog Engine with A Strange Name

The _Marcel Kernel_ became the _Bright_ one because of Github suggestions.

It's the _core_, the _kernel_, the _engine_ of a small blog made of `.less` and `.js` files,
without any server _engine_. All is running from the client.

I think you better have a recent browser to use it, _i.e._ forget all _Internet Explorer_ before 10.

## Note
Today, it's a _work in progress_, an _experimental_ project which doesn't work well.
